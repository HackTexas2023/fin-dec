Personal Finance Decision Maker [findec.tech](findec.tech)

## Inspiration
Energized by the drive for financial independence, our journey began with a spark of insight! Surveying fellow students at UT, we uncovered a gap in understanding financial planning. The enthusiasm to bridge this gap fueled our quest. Fueled by their lack of knowledge, we embarked on a mission: to empower students with the wisdom of financial freedom. The result? An inspiring web application that opens the door to a worry-free financial journey, encouraging every student to dream big and achieve more!

## What it does
Fin.dec is a web application designed to provide users with personalized advice on how to allocate their retirement investments based on their current financial situation and goals. It takes user inputs, such as age, current savings, income, risk tolerance, and retirement goals, and then generates a tailored investment strategy. This includes recommendations on asset allocation, types of investment accounts, and specific investment options. It educates users on the importance of diversification and helps them make more informed decisions regarding their financial future.

## How we built it
We developed fin.dec using a combination of modern web development frameworks and tools. The core of the application relies on a robust decision-making model that assesses various retirement accounts, weighing factors like growth potential and tax benefits to determine the optimal allocation for each user. Here's an overview of the technologies and processes that powered fin.dec:

**Front-End Development:** For the user interface, we utilized the React.js framework, a popular JavaScript library for building responsive and interactive web interfaces. React allowed us to create a dynamic and user-friendly front-end experience.

**Back-End Development:** On the server side, we chose Flask, a lightweight and efficient web framework for Python. Flask provided the necessary infrastructure to handle user requests, process data, and communicate with the decision-making model.

**Decision-Making Model:** At the heart of Findec is a sophisticated decision-making model. This model evaluates different retirement accounts available to users, considering a range of factors. These factors include the historical performance of investment options, tax implications, and the user's risk tolerance. By carefully weighing these factors, the model determines the optimal allocation strategy for each individual.

**User Database:** User data is stored securely in a MongoDB database. MongoDB's flexibility and scalability make it an excellent choice for storing user profiles, investment preferences, and account information. It also enables us to provide a personalized experience to each user.

**Scalability:** To accommodate a growing user base and increased data volume, the architecture of Findec is designed for scalability. This ensures that the application can handle a larger number of users without compromising performance.

**User Interface Design:** The user interface was designed with user experience in mind. We used Figma to create the intuitive design and ease of navigation that helps users understand the recommendations and make informed decisions.

The synergy of React, Flask, MongoDB, Figma, and a sophisticated decision-making model allows fin.dec to provide users with personalized retirement investment advice. This technology stack not only enables users to make informed investment decisions but also ensures that their data is handled securely and that the application remains adaptable and up to date.

## Challenges we ran into
The development of fin.dec presented several formidable challenges, with one of the most significant being the complexities surrounding the decision-making model. This model is the core component of the application, responsible for assessing the benefits of various retirement accounts, including growth potential and tax advantages, to provide users with optimal allocation recommendations. Here's an in-depth look at the challenges we encountered:

**Complexity of Financial Knowledge:** The world of finance is intricate and highly specialized, requiring a deep understanding of tax laws, investment regulations, and the nuances of different retirement accounts. This challenge was particularly pronounced for our team, composed of Electrical and Computer Engineering majors, who initially lacked extensive financial expertise.

**Tax Law Variations:** Developing an accurate model necessitated a profound grasp of tax laws and regulations, which vary significantly across different regions and account types. This meant that we had to meticulously research and understand the intricacies of tax laws in various locations.

**Account Diversity:** Different retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s, IRAs, Roth IRAs, and pension plans, come with their own unique rules, contribution limits, and tax treatments. To create a model that could provide accurate recommendations, we needed to gain expertise on the details of each type of account.

## Accomplishments
We take immense pride in our groundbreaking prediction algorithm, crafted to tailor financial profiles for users across diverse age groups. This innovative approach ensures users meet both current and future financial aspirations with precision and foresight. Recognizing the vital role personal finance plays in shaping our destinies, we've taken a significant leap toward a future where financial literacy is paramount. This achievement marks not just a step, but a giant stride towards a financially enlightened future for all, leaving a lasting impact on the path to prosperity.
